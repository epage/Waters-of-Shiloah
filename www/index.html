		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>5 The Lord spake also unto me again, saying,</p>
		<p>6 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;</p>
		<p>7 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and go over all his banks:</p>
		<p>8 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall rech even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</p>
		<p>9 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.</p>
		<p>10 Take acounsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for bGod is with us.</p>
		<p>Isaiah 8:5-10 (KJV)</p>
